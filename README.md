# Metro-information-system

I did the project for the metro station in the Information Systems course in my third year. One part of the project was created in Maven and JUnit tests, while the other part is a dynamic web application. The second part of the project was created in Java, using Hibernate, Docker and PHP scripts. MySQL was used for the database.
